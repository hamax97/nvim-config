# NvChad custom configuration

This branch, `nvchad`, contains my custom configuration for the [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) Neovim configuration.

Clone this to `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom` like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamax97/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom
```

You might need to setup NvChad first. [Read the official docs for that](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install).

For a new distribution other than NvChad, remember to create a new branch with the name of this distrubtion. For example:

```
git checkout main
git checkout -b lunarvim
```
